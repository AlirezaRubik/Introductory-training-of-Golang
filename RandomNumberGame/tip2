/*
Package main implements a simple number guessing game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number.

The program generates a random number between 0 and 999 and prompts the user to guess it. The user receives feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number or chooses not to continue.

Usage:
1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to guess the random number.
3. After guessing the correct number, you can choose to play again or exit the game.

Functions:
- RandomNumber: Generates a random number and allows the user to guess it, providing feedback on the guesses.

Main Logic:
1. The main function contains a loop that calls the RandomNumber function.
2. After each game, the user is asked if they want to continue. If the user enters anything other than 'y', the game exits.
3. The RandomNumber function generates a random number and prompts the user for guesses, counting the number of tries until the user guesses correctly.

Example:
*/

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
)

func main() {
	for {
		RandomNumber()
		var choice string
		fmt.Print("Do you want to continue? [y/n]: ")
		fmt.Scanln(&choice)
		if choice != "y" {
			break
		}
	}
}

func RandomNumber() {
	rnd := rand.Intn(1000)
	count := 0
	for {
		fmt.Println("Please enter a random number:")
		var input int
		fmt.Scanln(&input)
		count++
		if rnd == input {
			fmt.Printf("You win after %d tries!\n", count)
			break
		} else if rnd < input {
			fmt.Println("Enter a smaller number.")
		} else {
			fmt.Println("Enter a bigger number.")
		}
	}
}
